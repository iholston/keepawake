# keepawake

Very simple powershell scripts to keep your computer awake. Choose whichever works best for you.<br><br>
`keepalive.ps1` - Runs indefinitely. No shenanigans. <br><br>
`keepalive_prompt.ps1` - Prompts you to enter the time you want the script to run until every time you run the script.<br><br>
`keepalive_time.ps1` - Set the time you want the script to run until from within the script for simpler reuse.<br><br>


## Can't run .ps1 files?
Sometimes organizations will not allow .ps1 files to run directly. Fear not, as long as PowerShell ISE is still installed you can run the scripts.
#### Steps to follow:
- Hit the windows key
- Type "PowerShell ISE" and Press Enter
- Click the "New Script" icon in the top left or press Control+N
- Copy the code from the script you want to run into the white script area
- Run the code via the "Run Script" icon or press F5
